# MR-booking
  This project arose from the problem faced by many Letovo musicians, which include us, the projects' creators.
  Music rooms are for music practice, not chill or hanging out! But many do not understand this and go there to have fun, so there are no free rooms.
  We are going to introduce online booking. It works like this: when you need to practice, you book any avaliable room on the site and
  if there's anyone in the room at that time, you can legally ask them to free it.
